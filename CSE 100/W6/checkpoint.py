# First, ask for a rating from 1â€“10 on the following:
# How large is the loan?
# How good is your credit history?
# How high is your income?
# How large is your down payment?

# First, check if the loan size is at least 5. If it is, use the following rules:
# If the credit history and income are both at least 7, then the decision is "yes"
# If either the credit history or income is at least 7, then check if the down payment 
# is at least 5, if it is, the decision is "yes", if not, the decision is "no"
# Otherwise (if neither the credit history nor income is at least 7), the decision is "no"

# Otherwise (if the loan is not 5 or greater), use these rules:
# If the credit is less than 4, then the decision is "no"
# Otherwise, check the following:
# If either the income or the down payment is at least 7, the decision is "yes"
# If both the income and the down payment are at least 4, then the answer is "yes"
# Otherwise, the decision is "no"
